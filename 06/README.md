[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) color scale.

an iteration on the [Lyme Disease Chloropleth](http://bl.ocks.org/dhoboy/8550256d9ffe6d42dc2101278ab41034) block from [@dhoboy](https://twitter.com/dhoboy)

this iteration:

- centers the view on Florida
- shows only the geography that is Florida
- updates the example to d3v4
- makes the code nice to work with
- removes the radio button that filter by year, to simplify the example
- adds an onClick event to the background that shows a border,
  which can be helpful for debugging map projections
